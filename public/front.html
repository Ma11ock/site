This site is a celebration of old computers and technology (or, what is old and nostalgic to me). Everything here is designed to look like a Linux desktop from between the years 2008-2012. That was the last time you could still feel 90's era optimism about technology (or the future in general), and the first time I used Linux (my father started me on Ubuntu 08.04 when I was 10).

In current year it's impossible to feel anything but disgust and disappointment over the state of technology. Social media has enabled conformism in a way never before thought possible. Every electronic device is a government surveillance machine. Unix is <span class="underline">still</span> using X11. Perhaps the Vi guy was right <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/">to go full AnPrim</a>.

But this site at www.ryanmj.xyz <span class="underline">is not</span> about that. Instead, this is a place to LARP and pretend it's still 2008. It is a place where we can live in a world before Jack Dorsey literally ruined everything.
