  This site is a celebration of old computers and technology (or, what is old and
  nostalgic to me). Everything here is designed to look like a late 2000's
  or early 2010's Linux desktop since that was the last time you could still feel
  90's era optimism about technology (or the future in general).

  In current year it's impossible to feel anything but disgust and disappointment
  over the state of technology. Social media has enabled conformism in a way
  never before thought possible. Every electronic device is a government surveillance
  machine. Unix is <span class="underline">still</span> using X11. Perhaps
  the Vi guy was right <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/">to go full AnPrim</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  But this site at www.ryanmj.xyz <span class="underline">is not</span> about that.
  Instead, this is a place to LARP and pretend it's still 2008.
